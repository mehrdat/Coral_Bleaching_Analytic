## Coral Bleaching

I looked at the coral bleaching dataset, and did tests, from hypothesis tests to chi-square tests and also regression test. I did most of this exploration in the R language. Some parts of it have been done in Python. 
Based on this report I got the idea that the bleaching percentage is not that bad I thought, but still getting worse. 

More, EDA ( explorative data analytics) could be done on the data. Like machine learning and, other models.
